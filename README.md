**mdadm** is a utility used to create and manage **software RAID** devices implemented through
**Multiple devices driver (MD)** in kernel. It supports following RAID metadata formats:

* [Linux native RAID](https://raid.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/RAID_superblock_formats):

  Known as **native** or **native RAID**. First and default metadata format. Metadata management
  is implemented in **MD driver**.

* Matrix Storage Manager Support (no reference, metadata format documentation is proprietary).

  Known as **IMSM**. Metadata format developed and maintained by **IntelÂ®** as a part of **VROC**
  solution. There are some functional differences between **native** and **imsm**. The most
  important difference is that the metadata is managed from userspace.

  **CAUTION:** **imsm** is compatible with **Intel RST**, however it is not officially supported.
  You are using it on your own risk.

* [Common RAID DDF Specification Revision](https://www.snia.org/sites/default/files/SNIA_DDF_Technical_Position_v2.0.pdf)

    **IMPORTANT:** DDF is in **maintenance only** mode. There is no active development around it.
    Please do not use it in new solutions.

# How to Contribute

 **mdadm** is hosted on [kernel.org](https://kernel.org/). You can access repository
[here](https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/utils/mdadm/mdadm.git).

It is maintained similarly to kernel, using *mailing list*. Patches must be send through email.
Please familiarize with general kernel
[submitting patches](https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/v4.17/process/submitting-patches.html)
documentation. Formatting, tags and commit message guidelines applies to **mdadm**.

## Sending patches step-by-step

To maximize change of patches being taken, follow this instruction when submitting:

1. Create possibly logically separated commits and generate patches:

   Use ``git format-patch --cover-letter --signoff -v <nr>`` to create patches:
   * ``--cover-letter`` can be skipped if it is only one patch;
   * ``--signoff`` adds sign-off tag;
   * ``-v <nr>`` indicates review revision number, sender should increment it before resending.

2. Check style of every patch with kernel
   [checkpatch](https://docs.kernel.org/dev-tools/checkpatch.html) script:

   It is important to keep same coding style that is why in **mdadm**
   [kernel coding style](https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/v4.10/process/coding-style.html)
   is preferred. ``checkpath --no-tree <patch_file>`` can be used to verify patches.
   Following checkpatch issues can be ignored:
   - New typedefs.
   - comparing with *True/False*.
   - kernel *MAINTAINERS* file warning.
   - *extern* keyword in headers.

3. Send patches using ``git send-mail --to=linux-raid@vger.kernel.org <cover-letter> <patch1> <patch2> (...)``

# Maintainers

It is good practice to add **mdadm maintainers** to recipients for patches:

- Jes Sorensen <jes@trained-monkey.org>;
- Mariusz Tkaczyk <mariusz.tkaczyk@linux.intel.com>;

Adding **MD maintainers** could be reasonable, especially if patches may affect MD driver:

- Song Liu <song@kernel.org>;
- Yu Kuai <yukuai3@huawei.com>;

# Reviewers

**mdadm** utility is not part of kernel tree, so there is no certificated *Reviewers* list. Everyone
can comment on mailing list, last decision (and merging) belongs to maintainers.

# Minimal supported kernel version

We do not support kernel versions below **v3.10**. Please be aware that maintainers may remove
workarounds and fixes for legacy issues.
